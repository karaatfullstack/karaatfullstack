### How to make a Github portfolio
1. Go to your Github page and click to create a new repo
2. Name that repo the same thing as your username (If your username is coolcode2000, name your repo that as well)
3. Once you've typed in the repo name, a message will appear:
<img width="650" alt="Github Readme" src="https://github.com/karaatfullstack/karaatfullstack/assets/116577743/1478056d-87ba-48de-b694-05471c52c76c">

4. Make sure to select PUBLIC as the type of repo, and to check the box that adds a README file
5. Create your repo and head back to your main profile page - you'll see the file appear at the top!

### How to make your page B-E-A-utiful
1. Add images:
  - You can simply drag and drop images from your computer to Github, and it will be saved in your assets folder. Dropping the image will create an img tag in your README, which will have 'width' and 'alt' attributes that you can update to resize and change.

2. Add gifs:
  - The easiest way to do this is save the gif to your computer, then drag and drop it into the README file
  - The other way is by going to a site like giphy.com and choosing a gif. Once selected, choose the "Embed" option
  - Don't paste the entire div into your README - instead right click on the image and select "copy image address". Create an img tag and place that address in your 'src' attribute - the img element will display your gif, and will look amazing.

 </p>

 - Remember that when you're taking images you check that they are free to use! If a site requires you to link back to it, you can do so with an HTML anchor tag
 - You can center and style items using HTML. To get the gif centered, I placed my img element into a paragraph:
```
<p align="center">
   <img src="myImage.jpg"/>
 </p>
```

3. Add badges:
A badge is a logo image you can add to link other social media and portfolio sites.

The standard code:
```![Badge Name](https://img.shields.io/badge/BadgeName-hexColorforBackground)```

So, to make a LinkedIn badge, this is the code and result:

```![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-0A66C2)```
