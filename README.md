### How to make a Github portfolio
1. Go to your Github page and click to create a new repo
2. Name that repo the same thing as your username (If your username is coolcode2000, name your repo that as well)
3. Once you've typed in the repo name, a message will appear:
<img width="650" alt="Github Readme" src="https://github.com/karaatfullstack/karaatfullstack/assets/116577743/1478056d-87ba-48de-b694-05471c52c76c">

4. Make sure to select PUBLIC as the type of repo, and to check the box that adds a README file
5. Create your repo and head back to your main profile page - you'll see the file appear at the top!
